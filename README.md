### The Snake Game
 
## JS PROJECT
  * This Website was created for the sole purpose of completing the second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS, User Centric Design, JavaScript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development modules. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document.

## Design
 
# Colour Scheme
   *  The two main colours used to create the game are blue colour #hsl, and a yellow colour #hsl representing the snake and food. Other colours were also used for border and background colour between the two main colours to create sections when playing the game .
   *  I also used black colour  for my borders respectively and also cream colour #ccc for my game board to display the snake and the food .

# Typography
   * In built text font was used in creating the snake game from inception to conclusion.

# Imagery
   * No physical images will be used on the site. The snake image will be drawn with code by using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to display this on the HTML page.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

#  Languages Used.
   * HTML5
   * CSS3
   * JAVASCRIPT

#   Frameworks Libraries and Programs
   * Git
     - Git was used as a version control in the terminal.
   * Github
     - Github was used to create and store the project repository.
   * Gitpod
     - Gitpod was used to create my files and code the project.
   *jQuery

     - jQuery was imported from bootstrap to make the navbar responsive on smaller screen sizes.

## Feature

# Current Features
   * Reponsive
     - This is the first responsive snake game which is available  on all screen sizes
     
   * Features
     
   * Existing Features
     - Game Instructions.
     - Snake image.
     - Win/Lose Scores.
     - User input.
     - Snake Game button to start and re-start game.

# Features Left to Implement
     
   * Game modes: 'Easy' or 'Hard' mode will be added in a future release. Easy mode will start with no figure parts displayed, this will leave 10 guesses. Hard mode will start with the snake and the food structure already drawn, this will leave 6 guesses.

# Testing

   * Test Strategy
   * Summary
     - Testing is required on The Snake  JavaScript game created for JS Project . All features and user stories documented in the README are to be tested.

     - HTML code must pass through the W3C HTML Validator.

     - CSS code must pass through the W3C CSS Validator.

     - JavaScript code must pass through the JS Validator.

## Deployment

# Github, Gitpod, Git and Gitub pages

   * How to run the project:.

     - I first created a repository cloning the Code Institutes template on my github page.
     - Once created I opened the page in Gitpod.
     - I then used the terminal to create my index.html file ie, touch index.html.
     - I then created my assets folder , to hold snakeGame.js,food.js,input.js,snake.js and matrix.js.
     - I then created the style.css file within the css folder.

   * Git

     - Once I created the main files and folders I then used the git add . command to add them to the staging area.
     - Once they were staged I then used git commit -m "initial commit" to commit them to github.
     - I then used git push to push the files onto my gihub page.
     - I used these steps to commit the project regularly throughout the development to keep everything saved and up to date on my github.
     - To make my project live I then used github pages.

     - Open a workspace in gitpod in my github
     - create a javascript project in my gitpod
